## Why Musicli

- Full-screen terminal playback built for long focus sessions, not playlist management overhead.
- Live ambience mixing with six long-session layers: `rain`, `cafe`, `fire`, `thunder`, `forest`, and `city`.
- `Track` volume starts at `0.25` on first run and remembers the last level you used.
- Search that stays in the terminal and does not interrupt playback.
- Scene-driven visuals with a portable renderer by default and a sharper `chafa` path when available.
- One source manager for local folders, saved streams, and recent one-offs.
- Local-folder-first onboarding with a native folder picker on supported systems.
- A catalog-first music library with installable packs, ready for a standalone library repo or release assets.

`musicli` is not trying to be a generic music app in a terminal. The point is atmosphere with very little friction.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- `Node.js 22+`
- `ffmpeg` required for playback
- `chafa` optional, recommended for better scene detail
- `yt-dlp` optional, only needed for YouTube URLs passed to `--url`
- Native folder picker support:
  - macOS: built-in through `osascript`
  - Linux: `zenity` or `kdialog` recommended

Example dependency install:

```bash
brew install ffmpeg chafa yt-dlp
# or
sudo apt install ffmpeg chafa zenity
```

### Run From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/btahir/musicli.git
cd musicli
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Run the Built CLI

```bash
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

### Install As a Package

```bash
npm install -g @btahir/musicli
musicli
```

### First Session

```bash
musicli
musicli --folder ~/Music/Lofi
musicli --url https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk
```

If you just run `musicli`, it opens an idle welcome screen. Nothing starts playing until you choose a source.

---

## Use It

### Start Listening

```bash
musicli
musicli --preset chill
musicli --preset jazz
musicli --preset snow
musicli --home
```

Running `musicli` with no source starts idle and opens a welcome screen. It does not auto-play anything.

- `Local Folder` is the default path.
- On macOS, Musicli opens the system folder picker so you can choose music without typing the path.
- On Linux, it uses `zenity` or `kdialog` when available.
- If no native picker is available, Musicli falls back to the in-terminal path editor.
- If you already know the source, `--folder` and `--url` skip onboarding and go straight in.

### Shape the Room

```bash
musicli --rain 0.40 --city 0.20
musicli --forest 0.50
musicli --fire 0.25 --cafe 0.20
musicli --scene alley
musicli --scene-renderer chafa
```

The `Track` row starts at `0.25` on first run. After that, Musicli remembers the last `Track` level you used in `~/.musicli/settings.json`.

### Bring Your Own Stream

```bash
musicli --url http://myserver:8000/lofi-stream
musicli --url https://example.com/stream.m3u8
musicli --url https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk
```

Inside the app, press `o` to open `Sources`.

- `a` adds a local folder and opens the native folder picker when available
- `u` opens the stream URL editor
- `e` edits the selected saved source
- `d` deletes it

The source editor still supports manual paths and URLs, but the local-folder flow now starts with browse-first behavior instead of making you remember the path.

It gives you:

- one place to manage both local folders and stream URLs
- real cursor editing for the URL or path when you need it
- saved reusable stream sources alongside recent one-offs

Use `o` anytime to reopen your sources.

### Use a Local Folder

```bash
musicli --folder ~/Music/Lofi
musicli --folder "/Volumes/Archive/Focus Mixes"
```

Inside the app, press `o`, then `a`. On supported systems that opens a native folder picker; otherwise Musicli falls back to a manual path editor.

### Load Open Lo-fi

`Open Lo-fi` is published separately at `https://github.com/btahir/open-lofi`.

The simplest flow today is:

1. Download `openlofi.zip` from the latest release.
2. Extract it anywhere on your machine.
3. Point Musicli at the extracted folder.

Example:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/btahir/open-lofi/releases/latest/download/openlofi.zip -o openlofi.zip
unzip openlofi.zip -d ~/Music/open-lofi
musicli --folder ~/Music/open-lofi
```

Or just run `musicli`, choose `Local Folder`, and pick the extracted `open-lofi` folder from the welcome flow.

Local folders can be:

- a single folder full of tracks
- a nested folder tree with subfolders

Musicli scans recursively and picks up:

- `aac`
- `flac`
- `m4a`
- `mp3`
- `ogg`
- `opus`
- `wav`

For nested folders, Musicli uses the first subfolder level as the category label inside search and queue metadata.

### Manage the Library

```bash
musicli library status
musicli library packs --source https://example.com/repository.json
musicli library install starter --source https://example.com/repository.json
musicli library install full --source https://example.com/repository.json
```

- `cafe`
- `fire`
- `thunder`
- `forest`
- `city`

### Scenes

- `alley`
- `balcony`

## Library

The current app flow is local folders and stream URLs first. The `library` commands are there to support installable Musicli-curated packs and a future standalone library repo.

That gives `musicli` two useful modes:

- it can work with installable Musicli packs
- it can grow into a larger standalone library without changing the player architecture

Pack installs are manifest-driven. The CLI reads a local or remote `repository.json`, installs the selected pack into `~/.musicli/library`, and skips unchanged files on reinstall.

The main `musicli` package does not ship a music pack by default in this repo state, so `library packs` / `library install` should be used with `--source` unless you set `MUSICLI_LIBRARY_SOURCE`.

Useful library commands:

```bash
musicli library path
musicli library status
musicli library packs --source https://example.com/repository.json
musicli library install starter --source https://example.com/repository.json
musicli library install full --source https://example.com/repository.json
```

---

## Development

### Common Commands

```bash
npm run dev
npm run build
npm test
```

### Library and Catalog Tooling

```bash
npm run tracks:build
npm run library:stage
```

`npm run tracks:build` rebuilds the track catalog plus pack manifests.

`npm run library:stage` stages a standalone library source tree in `dist/library-source/` so it can be published separately later.

### How It Works

- **Library**: track metadata lives in a generated catalog and installable packs are defined by manifests.
- **Audio**: `ffmpeg` decodes and mixes the selected track plus active ambience loops, then streams PCM audio into `speaker`.
- **Renderer**: a double-buffered ANSI renderer updates only changed terminal cells.
- **Scenes**: PNG scene art is rendered through a portable cell renderer, with an optional `chafa` path for higher-detail terminal output.
